It was my first project where I utilized AI tools to generate website content. My client wanted a simple blog management system where they wouldn't have to manually search for and rewrite content for posts. Therefore, I integrated the external Google Gemini API, which, based on keywords, title, and existing post content, can generate additional sections and content, speeding up the work. If we don't have an interesting photo on the server, we can search for it using the included photo search engine pulling from the Pexels platform. These additional aspects significantly contribute to generating content of interest to us in unprecedented time. The application's state is managed by Redux, I used React Query for creating queries, and Prisma for integrating the database with the application. The application was containerized using Docker and is hosted on an OVH server.",
